# CulturAnalysis
Our team works based on the matters with unpredictable weather, pests and diseases, affecting many farmers today through gamification and community work.

Main Problem
Climatic factors affect the cultivation of many farmers, who are often not adequately informed about the weather conditions in their region with precision. This leads to unnecessary expenses, such as watering crops when the soil is still moist, and risks like floods that could be prevented, avoiding negative impacts on the producer.

Factors
Unpredictable climate (Water);
Pests;
Diseases;
Terrain geography (Floods and/or droughts).
NASA Database
Precipitation;
Soil moisture;
Topography;
Floods and surface water;
Flood frequency;
Vegetation.
Objective
Develop a tool that enables farmers to analyze data provided by NASA and understand concerns related to water, climate, and terrain for better agricultural practices, presented in a way that is easy to understand.

Planning
Our application focuses on assisting farmers by predicting how their land will react to drier or wetter periods, using a calendar that pulls information from NASA's own database. Another method for analyzing the region would be through the input of data provided by the farmer themselves. A community will also be implemented, focused on answering questions among farmers and technicians, where community engagement and activity will be encouraged through a gamification system that rewards the most active participants.

This system will also apply to setting harvest goals, where following planting recommendations will reward the farmer with points. By properly collecting these points, users will climb the ranking system, gaining more credibility, improving their reputation, and increasing the likelihood of receiving recommendations in the field.

The MVP of the project focuses on agricultural producers, analyzing data related to geographic issues (Topography, flood statistics, weather forecasts, etc.), and ensuring easy comprehension through calendars and dashboards for those who may not be familiar with more advanced applications.

Detailed Implementations
Management: Implementation of a calendar that shows dry and rainy periods. There will be both a linear view, focusing on the current day, and a grid view of the entire month.
Usability: Make the program easy to use, with eye-catching colors indicating important information, even for users with limited prior knowledge of the application.
Community: Creation of forums for questions and answers, improving communication between technicians and farmers.
Gamification: The app will include ways to make users feel more rewarded for completing tasks within the application.
Monetization
Available for free
Reading and analyzing data from NASA and farmer's own input;
Insights and dashboards based on weather reading and crop data collection.
Future Plans (Prioritized by order)
Improve point distribution system: Engage with the community, achieve goals, and assess production.
Technician registration: Implement an exclusive system for technicians, allowing them to assist farmers by providing services.
User verification method: Evaluate professionalsâ€™ history upon account creation, boosting their ranking after curriculum analysis.
IoT: Integrate the Internet of Things into the project, allowing data collection to be conducted through other instruments (such as drones).
